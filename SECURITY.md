# Security

UnifyMail takes the privacy of your data seriously. When you connect email accounts to the app, your email credentials are stored securely in your system keychain. UnifyMail does not transmit, store or process your mail in the cloud. For more information about how we protect and handle your data, take a look at the [Privacy Policy](https://getunifymail.com/privacy-policy). We've written up a detailed [breakdown of the information](https://foundry376.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002704911-What-data-does-UnifyMail-collect-when-I-use-the-product-) that UnifyMail stores in the cloud, and we allow you to [delete it all](https://foundry376.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001994551-How-do-I-delete-my-UnifyMail-ID-and-all-data-stored-on-UnifyMail-servers-GDPR in compliance with GDPR.

When you set up the app you can also choose to skip "UnifyMail ID" setup, which opts you out of our cloud features and prevents your data from being transmitted off your machine entirely.
